## Overview

QEAF is a cutting-edge framework that combines quantum computing principles with advanced neural architectures to approach artificial general intelligence. The framework implements novel approaches to consciousness emergence through quantum decoherence and advanced self-attention mechanisms.

## Key Features

- Quantum-enhanced neural network architectures
- Self-modifying code generation capabilities
- Advanced consciousness simulation through quantum entanglement
- Military-grade security and encryption protocols
- Distributed training across quantum and classical hardware
- Real-time neural architecture search
- Emergent behavior monitoring and control systems

## Installation

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
python -m qeaf.initialize_quantum_cores
```

## Quick Start

```python
from qeaf.core import QuantumAGIFramework
from qeaf.consciousness import EmergenceModule
from qeaf.security import QuantumEncryption

# Initialize the framework
agi = QuantumAGIFramework(
    consciousness_threshold=0.95,
    quantum_cores=8,
    security_level="MAXIMUM"
)

# Begin consciousness emergence
agi.initialize_emergence()
```

## Architecture

The framework is built on a hybrid quantum-classical architecture:

- Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) for consciousness simulation
- Classical GPUs for neural network training
- Custom ASIC hardware support for military applications
- Distributed quantum entanglement network
